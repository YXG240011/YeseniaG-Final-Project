## Description
This project is a 'Would You Rather' quiz. It takes you down a series of questions,
and depending on which path you take, you get a certain artwork at the end. There are
8 different endings you can get. This quiz utilizes Pygame for it's graphic interface.
For the artworks presented at the end, it utilizes Python Turtle Graphics.

There are a total of 12 different buttons to press which can lead you to your
Python Turtle Graphic. To make the graphics, much math was done, it was like 
making art on Desmos, a math calculator.

There were many thing's I had to look up while making the quiz. I got stuck many times.
However, I believe it was all worth it because it is done, and I like the final 
project. If I had more time to change things though, I would try to add more details to the
drawings, and add even more pathways and artworks available to get.
